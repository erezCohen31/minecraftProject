    <h1>MINECRAFT</h1>
    <p id="des">
      Welcome to a vibrant 2D sandbox adventure inspired by the spirit of
      Minecraft, where creativity meets strategy in a side-scrolling pixel
      world. Players are equipped with four specialized tools, each designed to
      interact with a specific type of block: slice through leafy foliage, chop
      down sturdy tree trunks, dig into earthy dirt, or clear away sky blocks to
      open new paths. As you explore the terrain, you'll need to think
      tactically—switching tools to navigate obstacles, uncover hidden
      resources, and reshape the environment to suit your goals. Whether you're
      carving out a cozy base, building towering structures, or simply
      experimenting with the world around you, every block removed brings new
      possibilities. With intuitive mechanics and a charming retro aesthetic,
      this game invites players of all ages to dive into a world where every
      tool unlocks a new layer of discovery. Ready to dig in and craft your own
      story?
